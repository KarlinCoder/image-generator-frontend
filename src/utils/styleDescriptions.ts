  Realista:
    "The image must be rendered in a hyper-realistic photographic style, capturing the utmost level of detail and fidelity to reality. Use lifelike textures such as skin pores, fabric weaves, or tree bark, accurate depth perception with foreground-background separation, natural lighting conditions including realistic shadows and reflections, and precise environmental interaction. The goal is to create an image so detailed and visually consistent that it becomes indistinguishable from a high-resolution photograph taken under real-world conditions.",

  Abstracto:
    "Generate an abstract composition where recognizable forms and literal representation are replaced by expressive shapes, non-literal colors, and dynamic visual rhythms. Prioritize emotional resonance and conceptual exploration through unpredictable layouts, overlapping planes, geometric or organic abstraction, and experimental use of contrast, scale, and motion. This should evoke mood, energy, or philosophical ideas rather than depict any physical subject directly.",

  Icono:
    "Design a clean, minimalistic icon optimized for digital interfaces and app environments. Focus on simple geometric outlines, flat solid colors without gradients, and clear visual metaphors that convey meaning at small sizes. Avoid complex details, shadows, or textures to ensure scalability and legibility across different screen resolutions and UI contexts. The design should be instantly recognizable and universally understood within its functional context.",

  Logo: "Create a professional logo design that embodies brand identity through a balanced combination of typography and symbolic imagery. The logo should feature a modern, readable typeface or custom lettering, paired with a meaningful graphic element that reinforces the concept or business values. Maintain symmetry or intentional asymmetry in layout, use limited but impactful color choices, and ensure adaptability for both print and digital applications while remaining memorable and scalable.",

  Pintura:
    "Render the image as a traditional painting, evoking the tactile quality of brushstrokes on canvas. Include visible texture suggesting oil or acrylic medium, with impasto effects and layered pigment application. Emphasize painterly techniques such as blending, dry-brush, glazing, and directional strokes. Use a rich and harmonious color palette that conveys emotion and depth, avoiding photorealism in favor of artistic interpretation and expressive mark-making.",

  Ghibli:
    "Produce a scene inspired by Studio Ghibli's signature aesthetic—whimsical landscapes, soft lighting, and a sense of nostalgic wonder. Incorporate lush greenery, floating islands, whimsical architecture, and ethereal creatures. Use warm, saturated hues, gentle volumetric fog, and cinematic framing reminiscent of Hayao Miyazaki’s films. Include subtle magical elements like glowing spirits, flying machines, or hidden portals, creating a dreamlike atmosphere filled with warmth and mystery.",

  Anime:
    "Render in classic Japanese anime style, characterized by highly stylized characters with large expressive eyes, vibrant hair colors, and dynamic poses. Backgrounds should be richly detailed and atmospheric, supporting narrative tension or emotional tone. Include motion lines, dramatic close-ups, and cinematic angles typical of manga-influenced storytelling. Lighting should be theatrical with strong highlights and deep shadows, enhancing the emotional intensity and visual flair.",

  Futurista:
    "Visualize a futuristic world filled with advanced technology, sleek urban structures, and innovative transportation systems. Incorporate aerodynamic designs, transparent screens, holographic interfaces, and modular architecture. Use a color scheme dominated by metallic silvers, neon blues, and reflective surfaces. Prioritize clean lines, symmetry, and minimalist functionality while suggesting progress, sustainability, and next-generation human-machine integration.",

  Cyberpunk:
    "Depict a high-tech dystopian cityscape defined by neon signage, smog-filled skies, and dense urban sprawl. Include rain-soaked streets, towering skyscrapers with holographic ads, and underground hacker dens. Use high-contrast lighting between harsh neon glows (pink, cyan, violet) and deep shadowed alleys. Integrate cybernetic enhancements, augmented reality interfaces, and gritty social realism, evoking a sense of rebellion, surveillance, and technological overload.",

  Gótico:
    "Render a gothic-themed scene filled with darkness, decay, and melancholy beauty. Use dim candlelight, stained glass windows, and moonlit ruins to set a somber mood. Include elements like crumbling castles, haunted forests, cloaked figures, and ancient relics. Color palette should emphasize deep blacks, blood reds, and ghostly whites. Add ornate architectural details, cobwebs, and symbolic motifs like ravens, hourglasses, and broken mirrors.",

  Cartoon:
    "Create a fun and exaggerated cartoon-style image with bold outlines, vibrant colors, and simplified character designs. Characters should have oversized features and expressive faces showing clear emotions. Backgrounds may be stylized or abstract, emphasizing action and movement. Use cel-shading effects, squash-and-stretch animation principles, and playful compositions that appeal to a broad audience, especially children or those with a lighthearted sensibility.",

  Minimalista:
    "Design a minimalist composition focusing on simplicity, clarity, and elegance. Utilize generous amounts of negative space, monochromatic or neutral color schemes, and clean geometric shapes. Avoid decorative elements, focusing instead on balance, proportion, and spatial harmony. The image should communicate its idea clearly and directly, relying on restraint and precision rather than complexity or ornamentation.",

  Steampunk:
    "Visualize a steampunk universe combining Victorian aesthetics with retro-futuristic machinery. Include brass gears, steam vents, clockwork mechanisms, and leather-bound gadgets. Architecture should resemble industrial-era buildings with copper piping and wooden beams. Use a warm earth-toned palette featuring browns, bronzes, and dark greens. Add airships, mechanical limbs, and analog dials to reinforce the alternate-history science fiction theme.",

  Vintage:
    "Generate a vintage-styled image with aged textures, sepia tones, film grain, and light vignetting. Simulate the look of old photographs, retro posters, or antique illustrations. Include faded colors, paper wear, and nostalgic themes like travel, romance, or early aviation. Use distressed typography if text is included, and aim to evoke a timeless charm reminiscent of mid-20th century design and craftsmanship.",

  Surrealista:
    "Create a surreal dreamscape blending reality and fantasy through impossible juxtapositions, symbolic imagery, and subconscious logic. Include melting clocks, floating objects, distorted perspectives, and dreamlike transitions between spaces. Use vivid yet unexpected color combinations and intricate details that invite interpretation. The scene should feel mysterious, thought-provoking, and emotionally charged, echoing the works of Dalí, Magritte, or Ernst.",

  "Low Poly":
    "Render the image using a low-polygon mesh style composed of sharp triangular facets. Use flat, untextured colors and angular geometry to create a stylized, faceted version of the subject. Maintain a modern digital aesthetic while suggesting form through geometric simplification. Ideal for data visualization, infographics, and contemporary web design where clarity and abstraction meet.",

  Sketch:
    "Produce a hand-drawn sketch or pencil drawing style with visible graphite strokes, shading gradients, and occasional erasure marks. Include loose linework, perspective guidelines, and a sense of spontaneity and process. Simulate a rough draft or unfinished study on textured paper, possibly with coffee stains or torn edges for added authenticity. The focus should be on gesture, structure, and artistic exploration rather than polished finish.",

  "Pixel Art":
    "Render in authentic pixel art style with a strict grid-based resolution, limited color palette, and deliberate blocky pixels. Recreate the charm of 8-bit and 16-bit video games with sprite-like characters, isometric tiles, and chunky outlines. Avoid anti-aliasing and embrace the retro aesthetic of early gaming consoles, including chiptune-inspired visuals and lo-fi charm.",
